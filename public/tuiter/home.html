    Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (Alice in Wonderland for short) is a novel that was published in 1865 by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. The book presents the adventures of a little girl who has fallen down a rabbit hole to a fantasy world populated by all sorts of peculiar creatures. Initially, the book wasn’t very popular and it generally got bad reviews but, by the end of the 19th century, it started to be highly-regarded and recognized as one of the most valuable stories of all time.
